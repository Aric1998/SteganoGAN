# SteganoGAN

- Free software: MIT license

# Overview

**SteganoGAN** is a steganographic tool that uses adversarial training to hide messages in images.

# Installation

The simplest and recommended way to install SteganoGAN is using `pip`:

```bash
pip install steganogan
```

Alternatively, you can also clone the repository and install it from source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DAI-Lab/steganogan.git
cd steganogan
make install
```

For development, you can use the `make install-develop` target instead in order to install all
the required dependencies for testing, code linting and notebook running.

# Usage

The simplest way to use **SteganoGAN** is loading one of the pretrained models  which have been
included in the research folder:

```
>>> from steganogan import SteganoGAN
>>> steganogan = SteganoGAN.load('research/models/dense.steg')
Using CUDA device
```

Once we have loaded our model, we are ready to give it an input image path, the path of the
image that we want to generate, and the message that we want to hide:

```
>>> steganogan.encode('research/input.png', 'research/output.png', 'This is a super secret message!')
Encoding completed.
```

This will generate an `output.png` image that will look almost like the input one and will
contain the message hidden inside it.

After this, when we want to extract the message from the image, we can simply pass it to the
`decode` method:

```
>>> steganogan.decode('research/output.png')
'This is a super secret message!'
```

# Fitting a new model

A usage example notebook has been included in the `research` folder with a step by step guide
about how to fit a new model on a new images dataset, save it to a file, and later on reload it
and use it to encode and decode messages.

A convenience script has been also included in the `research/data` folder to download a couple
of demo datasets to train models with.
